# DissertationFinal
data, analysis scripts, and stimuli for my dissertation experiments


**/JS_experiments:** contains code for experiment websites


**/results:** Within /results, there is a separate subdirectory for each experiment: /Exp1, /Exp2, and /Exp3 for the three main experiments, /NormingCCs for the CC selection study, and /NormingPlaces for the selection study conducted to select the profiles and localities.  The subdirectories for the 3 main experiments contain the four directories listed below.  /NormingCCs and /NormingPlaces do not contain the /models subdirectory. 

* **/data:**
  * **/experiment_trials.csv:**   original trial data (participants' responses to trials)
  * **/data_preprocessed.csv:**   preprocessed data (generated from /rscripts/preprocessing-sd_cuttofs.R) 
  * **/experiment-subject_information.csv:**   original demographic info for participants (participants' responses to demographic questions)

* **/graphs:** contains graphs used in the analyses, mostly generated by /scripts/graphs.R (These are not super well-organized.)

* **/models:** contains the models used in the analyses, mostly generated by rscripts/analysis.R

* **/rscripts:** contains scripts for generating the graphs, models, and preprocessed data as noted above.

There is an additional directory for meta-analyses comparing the results of the three experiments called /meta-analyses, which contains the graphs, models, and scripts for generating these.

There are also two scripts that are used by the analysis.R scripts:
* **helpers.R**: helper function for bootstrapping 95% CI, from Judith Degen. 
* **model_to_RTF.R**: takes a model object and converts it to RTF (which I ended up having to convert to jpg manually), adapted from Martha Austen.
