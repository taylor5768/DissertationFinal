My sister and I do speak another language to each other regularly and have done so since high school. We are both in our late 40s now and I will be 50 next week. This is an affectation to prevent someone who might overhear us from understanding, and we do not normally speak it with anyone but each other. We both have had extensive French language training, and use it to prevent others from knowing what we are saying if we are being jokingly insulting towards each other, especially silly, or cursing. I am also fascinated by language in general and have attempted to learn and retain more than a couple. I have also in the past, created a language of my own including an accompanying alphabet. I began this project in high school. A friend in high school who was interested in code-breaking attempted to break my ""code"" and told me at the end of the school year that he was impressed I had created a code he was unable to break. I let him know it was a full language and not a more simple code, and that there were many word and letter combinations that he might have been unable to work out due to the fact that I had specialized symbols that stood for two or more letters (or a specific sound) that were often combined within words.
